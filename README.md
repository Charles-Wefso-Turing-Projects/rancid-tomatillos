## Project Overview

  In this project we worked together to build an application using React and Router. Working together we built the majority of the app's components and functionality. We then took on individual components and integrated them into the overall application.

  By logging into the application, the user is greeted with their name and can see the movies they have rated.

  A user can add a rating if they have not yet rated a movie, and can delete that rating as well.

  A user can add a comment, but they better be sure! Because they can not delete it... yet.
